# SUMO-Routing-RL

## Summary

SUMO-Routing-RL is a reinforcement learning environment using the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) traffic simulator. This project aims to optimize vehicle routing for community vehicles based on passenger disabilities and the availability of public transportation options.

## Features

- Integration with SUMO for realistic traffic simulation
- Multiple reinforcement learning algorithms including DQN and PPO
- Modular design for easy extension and experimentation
- Support for prioritized experience replay

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Anaconda or Miniconda (recommended for managing dependencies)

### SUMO Installation

Follow the official [SUMO installation instructions](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html).

### Project Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SUMO-Routing-RL.git
   cd SUMO-Routing-RL
   ```

2. **Create and activate a conda environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create --name sumorl python=3.8
   conda activate sumorl
   ```

3. **Install project dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install SUMO as a Python package**:
   ```bash
   pip install sumolib traci
   ```

## Usage

To run the main training loop:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

To run with specific configurations:

```bash
python src/main.py --config path/to/config.yaml
```

**Note for Windows users:** Please use the `connect_no_gui` function instead of `connect_libsumo_no_gui` as `libsumo` does not work well on Windows.



## Documentation

Generate the documentation using Sphinx:

1. **Navigate to the `docs` directory**:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

2. **Build the documentation**:
   ```bash
   make html
   ```

3. **Open the generated documentation**:
   Open `docs/build/html/index.html` in your web browser.
